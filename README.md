# Hello! I'm Alex. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Rutgers University who writes code and columns. I'm interested in using my software engineering and writing skills to create valuable online experiences.

I write scripts, stories, and more. My humor column is distributed by Cagle: read it in the Delaware County Daily Times, the Gettysburg Times, and other papers!
