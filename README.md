# Hello! I'm Alexandra. 👋

I'm a student at Rutgers who's worked with Python, Java, and JavaScript. I'm interested in using web development to promote fun, valuable online experiences.

I also write comedies: screenplays, stageplays, short stories, humor columns, and more. 😁

Feel free to reach out!
